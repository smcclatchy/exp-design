### State the research problem or question
Clearly identify the research problem or question that the experiment will address.
What are some sources of variability in the experiment?

### Describe the population
Define the population to be sampled for the experiment.

### Describe how you will sample the population
samples should be representative of the larger population so that one can draw inferences
How will you sample? randomize? will you use blocking? stratification?
How large will your samples be?
Perform power analysis to determine sample size.

### Specify the experimental design

1. What are the experimental units?
2. Describe the variables: background, constant, primary, uncontrollable
3. Treatment structure: Drawing a design template is a good way to view the structure of the design factors.
Understanding the layout of the design through the visual representation of its primary factors
will greatly help you later to construct an appropriate statistical model. 
4. Design structure (i.e. blocks, completely randomized design, randomized complete block design, etc.)
