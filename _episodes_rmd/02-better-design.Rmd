## Why experiments need to be designed
We design experiments to help answer questions by comparing the outcome of different treatments. We can design experiments such that bias and error in the comparison of different treatments is minimized. We control experiments so that we can make stronger inferences about the nature of the differences that we see. Specifically, we try to make inferences about causation.  

The design of a study suggests its analysis. Knowing how a design can be analyzed is critical before embarking on experimentation.

Analysis can always be re-worked or re-done; the original study however, would be costly and difficult to repeat if done badly. In statistics there is no "magic bullet", or statistical test, that can correct every poorly designed study. The statistical test and the analysis must be determined in the planning stages of an experiment.

## Costs of poor design
Scientific research advances when scientists can corroborate others' results instead of pursuing false leads. Too often, though, published studies can't be reproduced or replicated, and the self-correcting nature of science falters. Some of these problems are entirely preventable through thoughtful and well-informed study design. 

### Time and money
According to [Chalmers and Glasziou](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140673609603299/fulltext?rss=yes), more than 85% of the dollars invested in research are lost annually to avoidable problems. Poorly designed studies are responsible for some of this waste. Given limited research funding it is imperative that experimental design, study quality, and reproducibility be prioritized so that research findings help to build stable and reliable scientific knowledge. 

### Ethical considerations
In animal studies, poor design often uses too many animals and is wasteful, or uses too few animals to obtain meaningful results. Poorly designed preclinical trials can lead to clinical trials involving humans with a shaky foundation of research findings. This is related to statistical power and inadequate sample sizes.

## Experimental design and statistics

## Why good design matters
Good experimental design seeks to balance statistical power, generalizability of findings, validity, practicality, and cost. It should be noted that improving one of the aforementioned often denigrates one or more of the others. For example, decreasing the cost of experimentation often negatively affects statistical power and validity.
