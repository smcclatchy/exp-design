## Controlling variability and maximizing effect
Kerlinger (1986) conceptualized experimental design as variance control [1]. The purpose of scientific research is to maximize variance explained (between-group variability, or signal) and minimize error variance (within group variability, or noise). Actual error variance should be reduced to uncontrollable variance by controlling extraneous variance.  
 
All experimental observations are a combination of signal, the true effect of a variable on an outcome, and noise, the random error inherent in your experimental technique. When designing and analyzing experiments, the goal is to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio so that you can draw accurate conclusions.
