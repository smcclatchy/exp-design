## Glossary

{:auto_ids}
blocking
:    Samples of similar structure grouped together from both treatment and control.

biological replicate
:   Parallel measurements of biologically distinct samples that capture random biological variation,
    which may itself be a subject of study or a source of noise.

factorial design
:   A design that permits testing of multiple variables at once.

randomization
:    A method to reduce bias and minimize the likelihood of chance altering the results of an experiment.

replicability
:   Other researchers obtain corroborating results using experimental methods similar to those of the original study,
    generating their own data independently.

reproducibility
:   Other researchers duplicate results and can draw the same conclusions as the original study did using
    the same materials and methods (i.e. specific measurement devices, original data, software, statistical method).
 
technical replicate
:   Repeated measurements of the same sample that represent independent measures of the random noise
    associated with protocols or equipment.
