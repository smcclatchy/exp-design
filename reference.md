## Glossary

{:auto_ids}
blocking
:    Samples of similar structure grouped together from both treatment and control.

biological replicate
:   Measurement(s) from biologically distinct samples (preferably taken at the same time) that convey the random biological variation that exists within a population.  Biological replicates should not be confused with technical replicates.

block
:

blocking
: used to reduce unexplained variability by grouping together samples of similar structure from both treatment and control. For example,
a new drug is tested on both male and female subjects. Sex of the patient is a blocking factor that accounts for treatment variability between males and females.

confounder
: An unaccounted for variable that exerts either a small or large effect on a dependent (response) variable.  Such variables increase variance and bias in the study.

control
: An experimental subject that does not receive the treatment, and that is used as a baseline to evaluate the effect of the treatment on another group of subjects.

controlled experiment
: an experiment done in parallel on a treatment and a control group that differ in one way (the independent or explanatory variable). Investigators determine which subjects go in the treatment group and which in the control group. For contrast, see observational experiment.

experimental error
:

experimental unit
:

factorial design
:   A design that permits testing of multiple variables at once.

fixed effects
:

observational experiment
: an experiment done in parallel on a treatment (or exposure) and a control group that differ in one way (the independent or explanatory variable). The subjects, not the investigators, determine whether they are in the treatment group or the control group (i.e. smokers and non-smokers). For contrast, see controlled experiment.

random effects
:

random error
:

randomization
:    A method to reduce bias and minimize the likelihood of chance altering the results of an experiment.

replicability
:   Other researchers obtain corroborating results using experimental methods similar to those of the original study,
    generating their own data independently.

reproducibility
:   Other researchers duplicate results and can draw the same conclusions as the original study did using
    the same materials and methods (i.e. specific measurement devices, original data, software, statistical method).

systematic error
:

technical replicate
:   Repeated measurements of the same sample that represent independent measures of the random noise
    associated with protocols or equipment. For contrast, see biological replicate.

treatment
:

variability
: the extent to which a distribution is spread out or squeezed in; also known as dispersion or spread

variance
: a measure of statistical variability or dispersion
